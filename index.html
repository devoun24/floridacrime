      <h1>Crime in the Sunshine State</h1>
        <p><i>By Devoun Cetoute</i></p>
    	  <p>
          474,481 crimes have been commited and reported by sheriffs' offices or county police departments from across Florida last year, according to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program. Crime is an event that will affect every citizen at some point in their lives. For some residents in the state that time will be sooner than later. This special project will show you what Florida cities are hotspots for criminal activity, see if the high amount of crime can be attributed to social factors and see how Gainesville compares to cities with similar crime rates.<br><i>All crime data has been gathered from the <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/tables/table-8/table-8-state-cuts/florida.xls">FBI</a> and social data from the <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/community_facts.xhtml">United States Census Bureau</a>.</i>

             The <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/ucr-statistics-their-proper-use">FBI website</a> tells us to be careful when ranking total crime.<p>"These incomplete analyses have often created misleading perceptions which adversely affect geographic entities and their residents," according to FBI documentation. </p><p> They go on to explain that rankings ignore the uniqueness of each area and don't take in-account the social aspects that could be affecting that area. Some of these aspects can be urbanization, economics, modes of transportation and climate.

             Every city has its fair share of crime and Gainesville is no exception.
